# Project 8: Working with cURL

## User Story:
As a developer, I want to interact with external APIs using cURL (Client URL Library) to fetch data or perform actions.

### Steps:

1. Learn the basics of cURL and its Node.js implementation.
2. Identify an API to interact with (e.g., weather data, social media, payment gateway).
3. Set up the necessary authentication or API keys.
4. Send cURL requests to the API endpoints and handle the responses.
5. Process the received data and display it in your application.

### Follow the steps below to get started with the project:
1. Clone the repository git clone <repository-url>
2. Navigate to project folder `cd Project8`
3. Install the required dependencies `npm install`
4. Obtain an API key from "http://openweathermap.org/"
5. Replace with your details: Update `PORT` and `key` with your personal information.
6. Start the project: npm start
