# Project 1: Understanding How Node.js MVC Frameworks Work

## User Story
As a developer, I want to understand how Node.js MVC (Model-View-Controller) frameworks work, so I can leverage their benefits in my future projects.

### Steps
1. Learn the basic concepts of the MVC design pattern.
2. Choose a Node.js MVC framework (e.g., Express.js, Adonis.js, Nest.js).
3. Set up the framework and create a simple "Hello, World!" application.
4. Explore the directory structure and understand the role of each component (models, views, controllers).
5. Build a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for a sample entity.

### Follow the steps below to get started with the project:

1. Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
2. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`
3. Choose your preferred Node.js MVC framework and follow its documentation to set it up.
4. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it: mkdir project1 && cd project1
5. Initialize a new Node.js project: `npm init -y`
6. Install the selected MVC framework: `npm install express joi`
7. Start building your "Hello, World!" application by creating the necessary files and configuring the routes.
8. Explore the framework's directory structure and locate the directories.
9. Implement the basic CRUD functionality for your sample entity by creating the necessary routes, controller methods and views.
10. Download Postman (API development and testing tool) from Postman website and launch the application.
11. Enter the URL for the get, post, delete or update requests in Postman to test your application's functionality.
12. Run `node index.js` and test your application locally to ensure everything is working as expected.
